    <h3 id="tribute-info">Here's a timeline of Nelson Mandela's life:</h3>

  
    <div class="middle">
    <ul>
        <li><b>1918</b> - Born in Mveso, South Africa.</li>
        <li><b>1933</b>- Mandela began his secodary education at clarkebury Methodist high school in Engcobo, a western style institution that has the largest scholl for black africans in Thenbuland.</li>
        <li><b>1937</b> - He moved to Healdtown, the Methodist college in Fort Beaufort attended by most Thembu royalty, including justice.</li>
        <li><b>1939</b> - With Jongintaba's backing Mandela began work on a BA degree at the university of Fort Hare, an elite black institution of approximately 150 students in Alice, Eastern Cape.
        He studied English, anthropology, politics, "Native Administration" and Roman Dutch law in his first year, desiring to become an interpreter or clerk in the Native Affairs Department.</li>
        <li><b>1941</b> - Mandela found work as a night watchman at Crown mines in Johannesburg.</li>
        <li><b>1943</b> - Mandela marched in a successful bus boycott to reverse fare rises.</li>
        <li><b>1944</b> - African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) was founded and Mandela was a memeber of the executive committee.</li>
        <li><b>1944</b> - Married to Evelyn Mase.</li>
        <li><b>1947</b> - Mandela was elected to the executive committee of the ANC's Transvaal Province branch.</li>
        <li><b>1953</b> - Mandela and Tambo opened their law firm in Johannesburg. The only African-run law firm in the country. It was popular with aggrieved black people, often dealing with cases of Police brutality.</li>
        <li><b>1955</b> - Mandela concluded that violent action would prove necessary to end apartheid and white minority rule. On his advice, Sisulu requested weaponry from the People's Republic of China, which was denied.</li>
        <li><b>1956</b> - He received his third ban on public appearances, restricting him to Johannesburg for five years, but he often defied it. Mandela's marriage broke down and Evelyn left him, taking their children to live with her brother. In December 1956, Mandela was arrested alongside most of the ANC national executive, and accused of "high treason" against the state. Held in Johannesburg Prison amid mass protests, they underwent a preparatory examination before being granted bail</li>
        <li><b>1958</b> -  His wife (Evelyn) withdrew her petition of separation in November, but Mandela filed for divorce in January 1958; the divorce was finalised in March, with the children placed in Evelyn's care. During the divorce proceedings, he began courting a social worker, <strong>Winnie Madikizela</strong>, whom he married in Bizana in June 1958. She later became involved in ANC activities, spending several weeks in prison. Together they had two children</li>
        <li><b>1961</b> - Mandela, Sisulu and Slovo co-founded Umkhonto we Sizwe ("Spear of the Nation", abbreviated MK). Becoming chairman of the militant group, Mandela gained ideas from literature on guerrilla warfare by Marxist militants Mao and Che Guevara as well as from the military theorist Carl von Clausewitz. Although initially declared officially separate from the ANC so as not to taint the latter's reputation, MK was later widely recognised as the party's armed wing.</li>
        <li><b>1962</b> - On 5 August 1962, police captured Mandela along with fellow activist Cecil Williams near Howick. Many MK members suspected that the authorities had been tipped off with regard to Mandela's whereabouts, although Mandela himself gave these ideas little credence. His hearing began in October, but he disrupted proceedings by wearing a traditional kaross, refusing to call any witnesses, and turning his plea of mitigation into a political speech. Found guilty, he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment; as he left the courtroom, supporters sang "Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika".</li>
        <li><b>1964</b> - Although four of the accused denied involvement with MK, Mandela and the other five accused admitted sabotage but denied that they had ever agreed to initiate guerrilla war against the government. On 12 June 1964, justice De Wet found Mandela and two of his co-accused guilty on all four charges; although the prosecution had called for the death sentence to be applied, the judge instead condemned them to life imprisonment.</li>
        <li><b>1964</b> - In 1964, Mandela and his co-accused were transferred from Pretoria to the prison on Robben Island, remaining there for the next 18 years.  Isolated from non-political prisoners in Section B, Mandela was imprisoned in a damp concrete cell measuring 8 feet (2.4 m) by 7 feet (2.1 m), with a straw mat on which to sleep.</li>
        <li><b>1982</b> - Mandela was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town, along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada and Raymond Mhlaba; they believed that they were being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists at Robben Island. Conditions at Pollsmoor were better than at Robben Island, although Mandela missed the camaraderie and scenery of the island.</li>
        <li><b>1985</b> - Botha offered him a release from prison if he "unconditionally rejected violence as a political weapon". Mandela spurned the offer, releasing a statement through his daughter Zindzi stating, "What freedom am I being offered while the organisation of the people [ANC] remains banned? Only free men can negotiate. A prisoner cannot enter into contracts.</li>
        <li><b>1990</b> - De Klerk announced Mandela's unconditional release. Shortly thereafter, for the first time in 20 years, photographs of Mandela were allowed to be published in South Africa.</li>
        <li><b>1991</b> - At the ANC's July 1991 national conference in Durban, Mandela admitted that the party had faults and announced his aim to build a "strong and well-oiled task force" for securing majority rule. At the conference, he was elected ANC President, replacing the ailing Tambo, and a 50-strong multiracial, mixed gendered national executive was elected.</li>
        <li><b>1992</b> - On 13 April 1992, Mandela publicly announced his separation from Winnie. The ANC forced her to step down from the national executive for misappropriating ANC funds; Mandela moved into the mostly white Johannesburg suburb of Houghton.</li>
        <li><b>1994</b> - The newly elected National Assembly's first act was to formally elect Mandela as South Africa's first black chief executive. His inauguration took place in Pretoria on 10 May 1994.</li>
        <li><b>1999</b> - Although the 1996 constitution allowed the president to serve two consecutive five-year terms, Mandela had never planned to stand for a second term in office. He gave his farewell speech to Parliament on 29 March 1999 when it adjourned prior to the 1999 general elections, after which he retired. Although opinion polls in South Africa showed wavering support for both the ANC and the government, Mandela himself remained highly popular, with 80% of South Africans polled in 1999 expressing satisfaction with his performance as president.</li>
        <li><b>1994</b> - In June 2004, aged 85 and amid failing health, Mandela announced that he was "retiring from retirement" and retreating from public life, remarking, "Don't call me, I will call you".</li>
        <li><b>2013</b> - After suffering from a prolonged respiratory infection, Mandela died on 5 December 2013 at the age of 95.</li>

        <blockquote style="font-style: italic; font-family: courier;"> "I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the idea of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an idea which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an idea for which I am prepared to die for."</blockquote>
